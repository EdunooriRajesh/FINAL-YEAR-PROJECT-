# 🌐 IoT Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 📖 Project Description
This project focuses on developing an **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** specifically designed for **Internet of Things (IoT) devices**.  
IoT devices are often vulnerable to various cyber threats due to limited security mechanisms. Our IDS aims to **detect**, **analyze**, and **alert** abnormal activities within IoT networks to prevent unauthorized access and attacks.

## 🎯 Key Objectives
- Detect malicious traffic and behavior in IoT environments.
- Classify attacks such as DDoS, spoofing, and unauthorized access.
- Provide real-time alerts without affecting the performance of IoT devices.

## ⚙️ Features
- Lightweight design suitable for resource-constrained IoT devices.
- Machine learning-based detection models (Optional if you used ML).
- Real-time monitoring and alerting.
- Easy integration with existing IoT systems.

## 🧪 Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (if ML used)
- Wireshark (for packet capture)
- Snort / Suricata (IDS engines)

## 🛡️ Benefits
- Enhances security of IoT ecosystems.
- Reduces the risk of cyber-attacks in smart environments.
- Provides scalable and efficient protection mechanisms.
